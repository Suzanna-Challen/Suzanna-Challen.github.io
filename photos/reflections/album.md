title: Reflections
---

I have become interested in capturing scenes created with reflections as a sort
of street photography. It is more magical realism than realism, more mood than
mob.

I am far from the first photographer to see this merged world, which is already
apparent in the Parisian shop windows captured by Eugene Atget, and in the blur
and steam abstracted glimpses of New York City street life captured by Saul
Leiter. Harry Callahanâ€™s experiments with double exposure are also an
inspiration.

As an approach, it is nothing new. But these artists captured specific places
at other times. My photographs have all been taken from 2014&ndash;2016 in Buffalo,
Hamilton, and Chicago, and their surroundings. They are scenes from a
contemporary Rust Belt that melds historic grit with shiny new glass.

Each of the nine images in this series are single capture images that play on
reflections of what is behind, through and beyond the glass. These scenes
emerge from an outer world reflecting off glass, merged with an inner world,
where light illuminates. In several there is even a third world of the view
beyond, as seen through an interior window. Reflections combine these worlds as
light and shadow allow, creating a new reality, sometimes beyond what might be
expected.
